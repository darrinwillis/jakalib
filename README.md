# A C++11 Implementation of `is_detected()`

I do a fair bit of metaprogramming but I rarely get SFINAE syntax right the first time. I suspect [this standard library extension](http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/is_detected&oldid=93627) will help but its rated C++17! So I'm going ahead and defining it using C++11 syntax.
